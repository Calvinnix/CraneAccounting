---Setup guide---
npm install gulp -g
***If npm fails, install npm. Google is your friend.***
npm install gulp gulp-babel gulp-concat gulp-connect gulp-react gulp-sass gulp-util gulp-watch scss-loader

---Preprocess Step---
gulp

^Running the above command will perform the following steps:
1. compile sass
2. concat js files to 1 file //todo:ctn minify?...
3. watches files for changes to automatically reload.

NOTE: If mvn fails you most likely need to install it. https://maven.apache.org/install.html

---Run Project---
***NOTE: you will want 'gulp' to be running, so create a new terminal window for this command***
mvn spring-boot:run

--Run Tests--
mvn test



--Weird things I encountered--
If none of the spring things are loading try to refresh Maven
If application.properties isn't being found make sure the resources folder is marked as 'resources'
^ Rebuild after doing this.
